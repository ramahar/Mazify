# Mazify
[Live version.](https://ramahar.github.io/Mazify)

Mazify is a Javascript browser application that visualizes maze solving and maze generating algorithms. A maze is displayed and the user can choose which algorithm to run on the maze. Algorithm will then be visualized on the maze 
    
## Architecture and Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Canvas
- HTML5 + CSS3

## Features
- Interactive interface with buttons for algorithms 
- Implementation of graph traversing algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra etc.)
- Render path-solving algorithm on a randomly generate maze using Canvas
- Dynamically manipulate the DOM using pure Javascript
- Add maze generator to generate new random maze on every click


## Algorithms
